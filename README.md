## Testing
- This project was built in Google Chrome, mostly in GitPod but also some from previous work in CodePen (cited below). It was tested in Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers and on mobile phones, laptops and desktop monitors. 
- The fixed header and NAV elements all work as intended, jumping to the correct section of the webpge.
- The quiz interactions all work (10/10 for Star Wars *is* the correct answer).
- The links to social media open in a new tab to the correct web address.  
- Also, when running Lighthouse, the SEO comes back limited due to links not being crawlable. But the links are from the font-awesome script and in JavaScript, which is outside of the current scope of this project.
- Accessibility needed to be improved on the 'Submit' button on the quiz. This was solved by increasing the font-weight from 'bold' to 800.
